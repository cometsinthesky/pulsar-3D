## Description 📝

Pulsar 3D is an interactive 3D simulation of a Pulsar, a highly magnetized neutron star with rapidly rotatition and emitting regular beams (pulses) of electromagnetic radiation. This simulation provides a unique visual and educational experience to explore the characteristics and dynamics of these fascinating astronomical objects.

## How to Use 👨‍🏫

### Requirements

- Modern web browser with WebGL support (recommended: Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Keyboard, mouse or Smartphone

### Steps

Accessing the simulation:

- Access the simulation web page at [https://cometsinthesky.github.io/pulsar-3D/](https://cometsinthesky.github.io/pulsar-3D/).

If you prefer to use the simulation offline, follow these instructions:
* On the [repository page](https://github.com/cometsinthesky/pulsar-3D), click on the green **<>code** button;
* Then, click on "Download ZIP", or if you prefer direct download click [HERE](https://github.com/cometsinthesky/pulsar-3D/archive/refs/heads/main.zip);
* Go to the location of the downloaded file and extract the files to a folder;
* Inside the folder, click on the **index.html** file and drag it to an open browser tab and drop it in that tab. The simulation should load automatically.
  
### Controls

- Use the left mouse button to click and drag on the scene to control the camera.
- Use the mouse scroll to zoom in or out from the pulsar.
- Use the right mouse button to click and drag the camera to another location in the scene.
- Play/Pause button: pauses and resumes the simulation.
- Reset button: resets the simulation.

## Simulation Dynamics 🎮🕹️

The real-time simulation of Pulsar 3D utilizes the Three.js library for camera control, 3D object creation, and functions such as the SkyBox for background control and 3D immersion.

The real stellar background from NASA, found in [Deep Star Maps](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4851/), provides an authentic and immersive environment for the simulation.

Furthermore, the simulation includes descriptive images of pulsar behavior, providing a valuable educational resource for classroom use. The simulation enables visualization and interaction with pulsar rotation, magnetic fields, and radiation emissions. Users can observe how these elements interact and affect the environment around the pulsar, providing a deeper understanding of these fascinating astronomical phenomena.

Now you are ready to explore the simulation and learn more about Pulsars.
