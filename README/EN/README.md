## Description 📝

Pulsar 3D is an interactive 3D simulation of a Pulsar, a highly magnetized neutron star that emits regular beams of electromagnetic radiation. This simulation offers a unique visual and educational experience to explore the characteristics and dynamics of these fascinating astronomical objects.

## How to Use 👨‍🏫

### Requirements

- Modern web browser with WebGL support (recommended: Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Keyboard and mouse

### Steps

Accessing the simulation:

- Access the simulation web page at [https://cometsinthesky.github.io/pulsar-3D/](https://cometsinthesky.github.io/pulsar-3D/).

If you prefer to use the simulation offline, follow these instructions:
* On the [repository page](https://github.com/cometsinthesky/pulsar-3D), click on the green **<>code** button;
* Then, click on "Download ZIP", or if you prefer direct download click [HERE](https://github.com/cometsinthesky/pulsar-3D/archive/refs/heads/main.zip);
* Go to the location of the downloaded file and extract the files to a folder;
* Inside the folder, click on the **index.html** file and drag it to an open browser tab and drop it in that tab. The simulation should load automatically.
  
### Controls

- Use the left mouse button to click and drag on the scene to control the camera.
- Use the mouse scroll to zoom in or out from the pulsar.
- Use the right mouse button to click and drag the pulsar and position it elsewhere in the scene.
- Play/Pause button: pauses and resumes the simulation.
- Reset button: resets the simulation.

## Simulation Dynamics 🎮🕹️

The real-time simulation of Pulsar 3D is based on precise astronomical models and physics algorithms. It offers a visual representation of the magnetic fields, radiation emissions, and rotation of the pulsar. You can observe how these elements interact and affect the environment around the pulsar.

Now you are ready to explore the simulation and learn more about Pulsars.
